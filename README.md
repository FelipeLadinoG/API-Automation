# API Automation

This project is an example of test automation for an API using RestAssured, Cucumber, and Java 11.

## Technologies Used

- **RestAssured:** RestAssured is a Java library used for testing REST APIs. It provides a simple and fluent way to send HTTP requests and verify responses.
  
- **Cucumber:** Cucumber is a behavior-driven testing framework based on natural language. It allows writing test scenarios in a human-readable format (Gherkin) and then implementing those scenarios in Java code using defined steps.

- **Java 11:** Java 11 is used as the language version to write test steps and automation logic.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, make sure you have set up your development environment with Java 11 and Maven. Then, simply execute the `TestRunner` class located in the `com.testing.api.runner` package. This class will run all the tests defined in the Cucumber feature files.
